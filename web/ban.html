Durga Puja is an annual festival for Hindu Believers. This occasion comes at the Hindu month of ‘Ashvin’ and lasts for 4 days. As you would expect, the event consists of family and social gatherings. Gifting to each other, lighting, and decorating houses are very common.  People worship their Goddess Durga inside temples. They perform ancient religious singing and dancing and paste powder color on each other’s faces to bring the celebration mode on. Eventually, the process ends with idol immersion in the river.
